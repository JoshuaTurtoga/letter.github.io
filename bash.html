		 	Labb,
		 	<br><br>
		 	I've been doing a lot of thinking since our fight, and I want you to know how much I regret everything that happened. Like the song "Pure Imagination", I realize now that I don't want to lose what we have. You mean the world to me, and I can't bear the thought of not having you in my life.
		 	<br><br>
		 	I know I've hurt you, and I'm truly sorry. If I could rewind time, I would do things differently. But since I can't, I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. I want us to move forward together, to leave the past behind and focus on building a future where we understand and support each other.
		 	<br><br>
		 	On this special day of yours, I want to remind you how much you are loved and cherished. You deserve all the happiness and more. I am grateful to have you in my life, and I promise to make every effort to be the partner you deserve.
		 	<br><br>
		 	Enjoy your birthday po, labbb. I love you more than words can say.
		 	<br><br><br>
		 	Love always,
		 	<br>
		 	-Joshua
